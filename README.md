# SecurityLens: AI+ SOC Platform Blueprint

Excellent! Here’s a **practical, step-by-step plan** to build SecurityLens as an “AI+” platform, inspired by Cursor’s agentic, context-aware, and user-centric approach.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **Context-Aware AI:** AI agents always understand what the user is working on—current dashboard, log source, query, or alert.
- **Natural Language Interface:** Users interact with SecurityLens using chat or a command bar (just like Cursor), describing what they want in plain English.
- **Agentic Automation:** Specialized AI agents can execute complex tasks, suggest improvements, and automate workflows—always with human-in-the-loop control.
- **Instant Application:** AI-driven suggestions (queries, dashboards, alerts) can be applied with a click—no copy/paste, no manual setup.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Users see changes, alerts, and recommendations instantly in the UI.
- **Extensible & Integratable:** Plugin SDK for custom agents, integrations with existing security tools, and support for multiple AI models.

---

## 2. Key Features (MVP & Beyond)

### A. MVP Features (First Release)
- **Log Ingestion & Parsing:** Connect to a few key log sources (e.g., Linux server, firewall, cloud logs).
- **AI Field Mapping:** AI agent auto-maps fields and types using LLMs.
- **Natural Language Chat/Command Bar:** User can type “Show failed logins from server X in the last 24 hours.”
- **Instant Dashboard Creation:** AI agent builds and visualizes dashboards or queries instantly.
- **Alert Creation via NLQ:** “Alert me if there are 5+ failed logins in 10 minutes”—AI sets up the rule.
- **Basic ML Job Orchestration:** “Detect anomalies in DNS logs”—AI runs and visualizes results.
- **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket-powered UI for live feedback.

### B. Advanced Features (Future Sprints)
- **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Orchestrate multiple specialized agents (threat hunting, compliance, enrichment, etc.).
- **Agentic Incident Response:** “Investigate this alert”—AI agent correlates events, summarizes findings, suggests playbooks.
- **Explainable AI:** Every action/alert comes with a “Why?” explanation.
- **Proactive Recommendations:** When idle, agents suggest dashboards, alerts, or optimizations based on data trends.
- **Plugin SDK:** Allow users/partners to add custom agents or integrations.
- **Multi-Model Support:** Switch between fast, accurate, or private LLMs.
- **Seamless Integration:** Pre-built connectors for SOAR, EDR, Slack, email, etc.

## 3. Sample User Flows

| User Command (NLQ)                              | AI Agent Action/Response                                             |
|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| “Show failed logins from server X last 24h”     | Query built, dashboard tab created, visualization shown             |
| “Is there an anomaly in DNS logs this week?”    | ML job runs, results visualized, explanation provided               |
| “Create alert for >5 failed logins in 10 mins”  | Alert rule generated, user confirms, rule activated                 |
| “Investigate this alert”                        | Agent correlates events, summarizes, suggests response playbook     |
| “Generate PCI-DSS compliance report”            | Report generated, mapped to incidents, downloadable as PDF          |
| “Refactor dashboard to focus on endpoints”      | Dashboard widgets updated, irrelevant ones removed, new ones added  |

## 4. Technical Stack Recommendation

- **Frontend:** React + Next.js (for speed, real-time, and rich UI)
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python) or Node.js (TypeScript)
- **AI/Agent Framework:** LangChain, LangGraph, OpenAI API, or open-source LLMs (Mixtral, Llama 3)
- **Database:** Elasticsearch (pluggable for future-proofing)
- **Realtime:** WebSockets (Socket.IO, Django Channels, etc.)
- **Integrations:** REST APIs, plugin SDK
- **Security:** OAuth2, RBAC, audit logs

## 5. Example MVP Sprint Plan

| Sprint # | Features Delivered                                                                 |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Log ingestion, storage, user authentication, basic UI                              |
| 2        | AI field mapping agent, NLQ chat/command bar, dashboard rendering                  |
| 3        | Alert creation via NLQ, basic ML job orchestration, real-time updates              |
| 4        | Audit logging, user management, MVP deployment, feedback loop                      |

---

## 6. Next Steps

- Finalize UI wireframes & interactive prototype for chat/command bar and dashboard studio.
- Define and document backend API contracts, data models, and Elasticsearch index schemas.
- Scaffold repo structure: `/frontend`, `/backend`, `/infra`, plus shared `/libs` for common types.
- Configure development environments & CI/CD:
  - GitHub Actions for linting, tests, Docker builds.
  - Environment variable management (`.env`).
- Implement MVP log ingestion pipeline:
  - Source connectors (Linux, firewall, cloud).
  - Parsing & field mapping agent stub.
- Build Chat/Command Bar MVP component in Next.js; hook up to backend NLQ endpoint.
- Schedule sprint planning session:
  - Assign owners for each feature.
  - Set Milestones & deliverables for Sprints 1–3.
- Prepare initial test harness with sample log data and unit/integration tests.

# Summary

**SecurityLens as “AI+” means:**
- Context-aware, agentic AI at every step
- Natural language, chat-driven operations
- Instant, actionable results (no manual query writing)
- Real-time, explainable, and extensible

**You’ll deliver a truly next-gen SOC platform, as revolutionary for security as Cursor is for coding.**
